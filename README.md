# Intelligent Art Style Classifier 

This project creates a complete engineering pipeline to classify and analyze art movements using MATLAB. It utilizes Deep Learning (ResNet-18) for classification and various Image Processing algorithms for scientific visualization.

## 🚀Features
* **AI Classification:** Distinguishes between 13 art styles (Baroque, Cubism, Realism, etc.) using Transfer Learning.
* **GUI Application:** A professional desktop app built programmatically with MATLAB App Designer.
* **Scientific Analysis:**
    * **Explainable AI:** Grad-CAM heatmaps visualization.
    * **Structural Analysis:** Canny Edge Detection.
    * **Colorimetry:** RGB Histogram Analysis.
    * **3D Topography:** Luminance-to-Height 3D Surface Mapping.

## 📦 Requirements
To run this project, you need **MATLAB** (R2023b or later recommended) with the following toolboxes:
* Deep Learning Toolbox
* Deep Learning Toolbox Model for ResNet-18 Network
* Image Processing Toolbox
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox


## 📊 Results
The model achieved **~64% accuracy** on the WikiArt dataset.
